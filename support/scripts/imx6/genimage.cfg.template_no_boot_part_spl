# Minimal SD card image for the Freescale boards Template for SPL Boot
#
# We mimic the .sdcard Freescale's image format:
# * the SD card must have 1 kB free space at the beginning,
# * SPL is at the offset expected by ROM,
# * U-Boot is at the offset expected by SPL,
# * The first partition is expected to be an ext2 and have a /boot directory.
